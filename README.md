# siglent-scope-viewer
This is a simple web viewer for a Siglent oscilloscope. The idea is simple: a
shell script periodically fetches the screenshot from the scope, and a HTML page
shows display the screenshot.

The shell script assumes that
[lxi-tools](https://github.com/lxi-tools/lxi-tools) is installed. Please change
IP address to suitable value.
